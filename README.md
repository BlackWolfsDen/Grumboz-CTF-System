Grumboz_CTF_System
==================

My Attempt at a capture the flag system

ok this is a rough draft....
there are 3 kinds of flags. 2 team flags (ally , horde) and 1 world flag.

you goal is to get your team flag to the world flag to capture the world flag.
the world flag will change based on what team captures the world flag.

easy to setup.
just find a nice zone and set your gps coordinates for each flag then restart core.
